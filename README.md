# Lucene - Sean

# Makefile
I will try to create a makefile which will handle compiling the code
In case I do not get around to it - run:
>javac -d ./classes/ -cp :./lib/* #JAVA_SRC_PATH

# Running
To run the code move to the classes directory and run:
>java -cp :../lib/* #JAVA_PROGRAM_PATH #COMMAND LINE ARGS
